## Problem Statements Addressed

1. **Orange Cap Holder**: Identifying the player with the most runs in a season or across all seasons.
2. **Purple Cap Holder**: Determining the bowler with the most wickets.
3. **Player Statistics**: 
   - **Batsman Stats**: Total runs, sixes, fours, and strike rates.
   - **Bowling Stats**: Wickets, average, strike rate, and economy.
   - **Slicers for Players**: Allows users to filter stats by player.
4. **Season-wise Data**:
   - Added a slicer to view stats for a specific season.
5. **Match Wins Analysis**:
   - **Wins by Team**: Visual representation of team performance over the years.
   - **Wins by Venue**: Matches won by different teams at various venues.
   - **Wins Based on Toss Decision**: Insight into winning trends for teams opting to bat or field after winning the toss.
6. **Match Results**: Matches categorized by result type â€“ runs, wickets, super over, or no result.

 The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from **Kaggle**.
 
## Data Processing

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed inconsistencies and unnecessary columns using Power Query.
  - Ensured integrity between tables by handling missing and duplicate values.
- **Data Modeling**:
  - Modeled three tables: `ipl_matches_2008_2022`, `ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022`, and `Calendar_Table`.
  - Established relationships between the tables to enable seamless data analysis.

## Key Learnings

1. **Data Modeling**:
   - Integrated multiple datasets and established appropriate relationships.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Cleaned data using Power Query to ensure consistency.
3. **KPIs**:
   - Designed KPIs to track:
     - Top batsmen and bowlers based on performance metrics.
     - Team wins by season, venue, and match result.
     - Toss decisions and their impact on match outcomes.
4. **DAX Queries**:
   - Applied complex DAX formulas to generate insights, such as:
   - Worked on dynamic measures like strike rate, economy rate, and averages.
5. **Time Intelligence Functions**:
   - Used `CALCULATE` with filters to apply seasonal logic.
6. **Visualizations**:
   - Designed charts, KPIs, and slicers for user interaction.
   - Created formatted and polished dashboards with shapes and themes.
7. **Insights Generation**:
   - Delivered meaningful insights through graphs and data points.
